# What is it

This is a repository to demonstrate `opentelemetry` observability using a manually instrumented library,
[fake-evaluator](https://github.com/everdark/fake-evaluator).

```bash
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the app, the telemetry will go to console, instrumentation is down at package level
python app.py
```
